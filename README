The main goal of this project is provide a port of Unrar library to iOS platform.

Currently we have two projects:

* Unrar4iOS

This project makes easy to build the unrar library as iOS static library.

* UnrarExample

This project give to us an example about how to use unrar in a iOS application.

Feel free to contribute with enhancements.


Installation:

Please open Unrar4iOS on XCode and build it, the framework package will be generated on build folder of project, copy it to a folder of your project  and add as existing framework to your project.


Notes:

Since this Unrar4iOS is cpp based library you will need to change the extension of classes that uses Unrar4iOS to .mm it will allow us to include  libstdc++ on linking stage, otherwise you will need to add libstdc++ as linker flags in you application.


CocoaPods:

Since some cpp files need to be downloaded, but can't be listed in the build phase, please add the following hook into your Podfile:

post_install do |installer_representation|
    puts 'Removing unwanted compilation sources from Unrar4iOS'

    excluded_files = File.readlines('Pods/Unrar4iOS/Unrar4iOS/ExcludedBuildFiles.txt')
    excluded_files.each {|file| file.strip!}

    installer_representation.project.targets.each do |target|
        if target.name.end_with? 'Unrar4iOS'
            files_to_remove = target.source_build_phase.files.find_all do |file|
                excluded_files.include? file.display_name
            end

            files_to_remove.each{|file| target.source_build_phase.remove_file_reference(file.file_ref)}
        end
    end
end
